# Summary - Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
* Data Analysis: 
    - Understand the variables (whether it is numerical, categorical, date/time, mixed, anything else) and Understand what we are trying to predict
        -  Also, check whether we have problem of missing data; if we have categorical (then we want to encode them into numbers); if the variables follow linear model assumptions, if the distribution is normal, skewed (if skewed, we want to perform transformations); if the variables contain outliers; if the features have different magnitudes (then we want to scale them)
    
*  Feature Engineering: 
    - We can create new features from dates, mixed vars
        -   we may impute missing values
            - we may perfrom numerical variable transform  
                -  we can discretisation
                    - we can handle outliers
                        -also feature scaling
